# Lunatic Vibes

Lunatic Vibes is a rhythm game that plays community-made charts in BMS format.

The project is basically a rewritten version of the Lunatic Rave 2. Some useful functions will be added in the future as well.

The project is still in development stage. Please do not expect a bug-free experience. Feel free to open issues.
