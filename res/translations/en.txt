Enable Standalone Preview
This option enables previewing charts with explicit preview audio files (e.g. #PREVIEW, preview*.ogg).\nIf disabled, the preview audio is ignored and Dynamic Preview is used instead.
Enable Dynamic Preview
This option enables previewing charts without any preview audio files, by loading the chart and its keysounds (same as LR2 preview).\nThis method may be relatively slow on regular BMS, since all keysound wavs should be loaded beforehand.
